holy shit my discrete math prof is so lenient
"homework and quiz makes up a large portion of your grade, you have unlimited attempts (10 max, just ask me for more), and i will drop 5 of your homeworks, and 3 of your quizzes"
and we have all day to take tests/exams, while also extremely leniently grading those
guy's just like "just pass my class bro"
no, i was watching lectures he uploaded earlier from last semester because he didn't have time to record new videos
and he was talking about how it's important to get your homework in because you had all semester to do them, and they can't be extended either
and by all semester, he means that all hw assignments were assigned at the beginning, and due some time around the very end of the semester
also i am struggling to live at the moment so my brain is a little bit underclocked atm
oh we had async classes today, where the hell is the lecture
i just remembered about it and i checked the zoom recordings and it is not there
and i have no idea where else it would be
why the FUCK do i have two final exams on the same day, and one of them is at 7:30 in the morning
also i am completely overwhelmed with assignments and i am considering not going to sleep
japanese and data structures
and for some god forsaken reason, calc 1 is on a saturday morning
i would say that's my only day i can sleep in, but last day of my jp class is nov 29, so i gets moved
i guess so
